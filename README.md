ChattyApp
=====================

A client-side SPA chat app clone using ReactJS. By using WebSockets the need for page-refresh is eliminated and new chats/updates are added in realtime. This project was completed in week 5 of Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp and was my first time working with ReactJS and Websockets.
